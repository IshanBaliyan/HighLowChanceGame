# High-Low Chance Game

The High Low chance game was made using JavaFX and was used as a class assignment for ICS 4U (Grade 12 Computer Science). It took approximately 2 months to make and several thousands of lines of code.

The game can be played in 1VS1, 2VS2, teamsVSteams, 1VScomputer, teamsVScomputerTeams and more. 

Quick game overview: The game lets players bet points for a high or low dice roll, while rewarding players for guessing correctly (rules further explained in program).
