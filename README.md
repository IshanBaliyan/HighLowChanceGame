# HighLowChanceGame

The High Low chance game was made using Javafx and was used as a class assignment for ICS 4U. It took approximately 2 months to make.

The game can be played in 1VS1, 2VS2, teamsVSteams, 1VScomputer, teamsVScomputerTeams and more. 

Quick game overview: The game lets players bet points for a high or low dice roll, while rewarding players for guessing correctly (rules further explained in program).

The game is highly customizable with full control over number of human players, teams, computer players, points, dice, sides on dice, and more:
